# ASSIGNMENT 5 XV6

## How to run
1. Run on this terminal as make clean ; make qemu SCHEDULER=<FLAG1> PLOT<FLAG2>
2. Here the flag1 is RR, FCFS,PBS,MLFQ. If SCHEDULER is not mentioned defualt we are taking RR. Flag2 is YESPLOT , NOPLOT, If flag2 is YESPLOT then  the required things for a graph will be printed to times.txt file and later used for plotting graph with python.

I have written the performance evalutions and graph plots in report.pdf , Here I have written implementations of things asked in assignment. I made a change in make file for flags;
```C
ifndef SCHEDULER
SCHEDULER := RR
endif
ifndef PLOT
PLOT := NOPLOT
endif

CFLAGS += "-D$(SCHEDULER)"
CFLAGS += "-D$(PLOT)"
```

## IMPLEMENTATION

### TASK1:

#### waitx syscall
int waitx(int *wtime,int *rtime) ;
for implementing this I have added 
1. ctime -> creation time of a process innitialised to ticks in allocproc() fn
2. etime -> endtime of a process intialised to 0 and equating to ticks in exit() fn
3. rtime -> runtime of a process initialised to 0 and doing ++ in updatetimes() when the process is in running state.
4. iotime -> iotime of a process initialised to 0 and doing ++ in updatetimes() when the process is in sleeping state.
And waitx is the modification of wait syscall with just changing to things
```C
*wtime=p->etime - p->ctime - p->iotime - p->rtime;
*rtime=p->rtime;
```

As for adding the syscall we have to add the some statements in these code sysproc.c , user.h , usys.S , syscall.h,
syscall.c , sysproc.c , defs.h , proc.c , proc.h.

and a userprogram is time.c in that i am calling  waitx to know that waiting and runtime of a command,
the command in terminal is time <command> command is like ls , echo etc;
```C
$ time ls

zombie         2 21 14908
console        3 22 0
wait time 1 , run time 24
```
#### ps user program

for this I made a ps syscall in that i am passing a array of data type struct procstatus. the  struct is as follows.
```C
struct procstatus {
   
    int pid;                    // Process ID
    
    char state[15];             //state
    
    int rtime;                  //run time
    
    int priority;               //default priority of the process is 60
    int w_timeforrunning;       //Time for which the process has been waiting (reseting this to 0 whenever the process gets to run on CPU or if a change in the queue takes place (in the case of MLFQ scheduler))
    int n_run;                  //Number of times the process was picked by the scheduler
    int cur_q;                  //Current queue
    int q[5];                   //â€‹ Number of ticks the process has received at each of the 5 queues
};
```
I am taking these quantities form ps fn form ptable and printing these in ps.c userprogram.

### TASK2
All the scheduling algorithms are written in scheduler fn. each algorithm will be taken according to the flag mentioned that was done in makefile.

#### FCFS:
in this at first i am finding the least the process which has least creation time. and cpu takes that.

```C
for (p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++)
{
  if (p->state != RUNNABLE)
    continue;
  if(nxt==0)
  {
    nxt=p;
  }
  else
  {
    if (p->ctime < nxt->ctime)
    {
      nxt=p;
    }
  }
}
```
as here nxt is the process whcih has least ctime in whole proc table.
so this nxt will take the cpu
```C
if(nxt==0)
    {
      release(&ptable.lock);
      continue;
    }
    // Switch to chosen process.  It is the process's job
    // to release ptable.lock and then reacquire it
    // before jumping back to us.
    c->proc = nxt;
    switchuvm(nxt);
    nxt->state = RUNNING;
    nxt->n_run++;
    swtch(&(c->scheduler), nxt->context);
    
  //  nxt->w_timeforrunning = 0;
    switchkvm();
    nxt->lastexecuted = ticks;

    // Process is done running for now.
    // It should have changed its p->state before coming back.
    c->proc = 0;
```

and In assingment they said to do nonpremptive fcfs so i am not doing yield() when the scheduler is fcfs

```C
if(myproc() && myproc()->state == RUNNING && tf->trapno == T_IRQ0+IRQ_TIMER)
  {
    #ifndef FCFS
    yield();
    #endif
  }
```

#### PBS:
1. For all the processes I am keeping 60 as the default priority for a process and for exec processes I am doing the priority as 3 and this 60 is assigning in allocproc().
2. here also finding min priority from the ptable.
```C
struct proc *nxt = 0;
struct proc *next=0;
for (p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++)
{
  if (p->state != RUNNABLE)
    continue;
  if (nxt == 0)
  {
    nxt = p;
  }
  else
  {
    if (p->priority < nxt->priority)
    {
      nxt = p;
    }
  }
}
```
In this assignment we have to do that the same priority process should run according to Round robin. So at first we got th eprocess with minimum priority.
as there can be multiple proccesses which have same priority so thate means this minimum priority also have multiple processes, so for that I am looping through the ptable and finding the first procses in the same priority. as we given to the cpu after that we will again loop through.
```C
 for (p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++)
    {
      if (p->state != RUNNABLE)
        continue;
      if (p->state==RUNNABLE && nxt->priority == p->priority)
      {
        // Switch to chosen process.  It is the process's job
        // to release ptable.lock and then reacquire it
        // before jumping back to us.
        c->proc = p;
        switchuvm(p);
        p->state = RUNNING;
        p->n_run++;
        swtch(&(c->scheduler), p->context);
        
   //     p->w__timeforrunning = 0;
        switchkvm();
        p->lastexecuted = ticks;

        // Process is done running for now.
        // It should have changed its p->state before coming back.
        c->proc = 0;
        int flag=0;
        for(next = ptable.proc; next < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; next++)
        {
          if(next->state!=RUNNABLE)
            continue;
          if(next->state==RUNNABLE && next->priority < nxt->priority)
          {
            flag=1;
            break;
          }
        }
        if(flag==1)
        {
          break;
        }
      }
    }
```

The processes can have priorities from range [0,100] , and we can set the priority of the process by calling a system call int set_priority(int new_priority,int pid)
This system call is not given we have to do it. for this i am writiing a syscall set_priority() and adding a system call has been done in waitx thing here is also same way , In this fn if the new_prioriy is not in range of [0,100] or pid<0 then it is a invalid thing and i am checking that whether the pid is there or not if it is there then we will change the priority of the pid and we will compare old priority of the procces with new_priority if new_priority < oldpriority then that means the processes priority increased (lower the value higher the priority). As the priority is increased we have to schedule again because this proccess priority may be greater than the running proccesses priority then we have to prempt the runninh procces. so in this case we have to reschedule again so thats why we are calling yeild() fn when new < old other wise noneed , And if the pid is not there then also it prints error.
```C
int 
set_priority(int new_priority,int pid)
{
  struct proc *p;
  int flag=0;
  if(new_priority<0 || new_priority>100 || pid<0)
  {
    return -1;
  }
  acquire(&ptable.lock);
  for (p = ptable.proc; p < &ptable.proc[NPROC]; p++)
  {
    if(p->pid==pid)
    {
      flag=1;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  if(flag==0)
  {
    release(&ptable.lock);
    return -1;
  }
  int old_priority=p->priority;
  p->priority = new_priority;
  release(&ptable.lock);
  if(new_priority <  old_priority)
  {
    yield();
  }
  return old_priority;

}
```
For this system to call we have a setPriority.c file where it calls this to set priority. and the syntax of the command to run on terminal should be setPriority <new_priority> <pid>.
